### 📖 Book Club
**Spending Pattern:** Very high overall spending with large, infrequent expenses. Likely categories: bulk book purchases, speaker fees, event hosting.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement purchase approval workflows for expenses above a threshold (e.g., $10,000).
- Encourage shared library models (bulk purchases distributed across members instead of costly individual copies).
- Explore donations or partnerships with local bookstores/publishers to reduce costs.
- Require the club to categorize expenses (e.g., books vs. events vs. admin costs) for better oversight.

### 💻 Coding Club
**Spending Pattern:** Medium-high consistent spending with more frequent transactions. Likely categories: software subscriptions, competition fees, equipment (laptops, devices).

**Recommendations:**
- Audit recurring software/tool subscriptions → ensure licenses are fully utilized and avoid duplicates.
- Promote use of open-source tools or institutional licenses instead of multiple paid plans.
- Encourage collaborative equipment purchases (e.g., shared server or cloud credits instead of individual laptops).
- Consider sponsorship from tech companies to offset costs of competitions or hackathons.

### 🎮 Gaming Club
**Spending Pattern:** $0 spending — either inactive or not reporting.

**Recommendations:**
- Encourage at least basic budget utilization (event snacks, tournament prizes, software licenses).
- Introduce low-cost/high-engagement events (LAN parties, online tournaments).
- Admins should check if the club needs guidance on submitting expenses.
- Consider reallocating part of their budget if inactivity persists after support efforts.

### 📌 Cross-Category Administrative Actions
- Require expense reporting by category (Events, Equipment, Subscriptions, Travel, Miscellaneous).
- Set per-category caps to avoid one club overspending entirely in a single area.
- Provide a template budget plan for clubs to submit before big expenses.
- Encourage fundraising or sponsorship for high-cost categories (e.g., travel, guest speakers).
- Introduce performance-based budget adjustments: under-utilizing clubs risk reductions, well-managed clubs can request increases.
