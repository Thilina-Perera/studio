### Spending Analysis: Book Club
**Spending Pattern:** Characterized by high-value, infrequent transactions. Primary cost drivers appear to be bulk book orders and occasional speaker fees for author events.

### Recommendations for Admins
1.  **Implement Financial Controls:** For single purchases exceeding a set threshold (e.g., $500), require a pre-approval workflow. This ensures major expenditures receive administrative oversight before funds are committed.
2.  **Explore Cost-Saving Partnerships:** Encourage the club to establish relationships with local bookstores or publishers to secure academic or bulk-order discounts, reducing the per-unit cost of materials.
3.  **Mandate Expense Categorization:** Require the club to categorize all expenses (e.g., "Reading Materials," "Event Speaker," "Venue Rental") to enable more granular financial analysis and future budget planning.

### Spending Analysis: Coding Club
**Spending Pattern:** Exhibits consistent, medium-to-high spending with frequent transactions. Key categories are likely software subscriptions, competition entry fees, and hardware components.

### Recommendations for Admins
1.  **Audit Recurring Subscriptions:** Advise the club to perform a quarterly audit of all software and tool subscriptions to identify and eliminate underutilized or redundant licenses.
2.  **Promote Use of Institutional Resources:** Guide the club towards leveraging university-wide software licenses or open-source alternatives before purchasing new, separate plans.
3.  **Investigate Corporate Sponsorship:** The club's activities are highly attractive for tech company sponsorship. Recommend creating a sponsorship package to offset costs for major events like hackathons or competitive programming leagues.

### Spending Analysis: Swimming Club
**Spending Pattern:** Very low overall spending, suggesting potential underutilization of its allocated budget. Likely expenses include pool rental fees and basic equipment.

### Recommendations for Admins
1.  **Conduct a Financial Health Check-in:** Meet with the club representative to understand if the low spending is due to inactivity or a lack of awareness of how to file for reimbursements.
2.  **Earmark Funds for Growth:** Proactively allocate a portion of their budget specifically for safety equipment and facility rentals to encourage more frequent and larger-scale activities.
3.  **Incentivize Event Hosting:** Offer a budget supplement for hosting an inter-university swim meet, which would foster community engagement and justify increased financial activity.

### Spending Analysis: Gaming Club
**Spending Pattern:** Zero reported spending. This indicates either complete inactivity or a failure to report expenses through the proper channels.

### Recommendations for Admins
1.  **Initiate Outreach:** Contact the club representative to determine if the club is active. If so, provide guidance on the expense submission process and budget access.
2.  **Suggest Low-Cost Engagement Activities:** Recommend starting with small, low-budget events like LAN parties or online tournaments, with reimbursements for snacks or small prizes to familiarize them with the system.
3.  **Budget Reallocation Warning:** Inform the club that if the budget remains untouched by the end of the semester, a portion may be reallocated to more active organizations in the next budget cycle.

### General Administrative Actions
**Financial Health Snapshot:** Across all clubs, there appears to be a significant variance in budget utilization. High-spending clubs are active, while several others show minimal financial activity, suggesting a need for broader financial literacy and engagement efforts.

### Recommendations for Admins
1.  **Standardize Budget Proposals:** Require all clubs to submit a simple budget proposal at the start of each semester outlining their planned activities and major expected costs. This creates a baseline for evaluating spending.
2.  **Host a Financial Workshop:** Organize a mandatory workshop for all club representatives on effective budget management, fundraising strategies, and proper use of the reimbursement platform.
3.  **Introduce Performance-Based Budgeting:** Implement a system where clubs that demonstrate responsible financial management and high member engagement can apply for supplemental funding, while chronically inactive clubs may see their budgets adjusted.
